The Electric Vehicle Population dataset contains information on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). Through exploratory data analysis, the top 10 counts of cars per county, city, state, and postal code were determined. King County had the most cars registered, followed by Snohomish and Pierce counties. Seattle had the most cars registered by city, followed by Bellevue and Redmond. Washington had the most cars registered by state, followed by California and Virginia. 

The dataset also provided insight into the top 10 consumed car makers by county, city, and state, with Tesla being the most popular make overall. There appears to be an opportunity for car vendors like Audi and BMW to market their vehicles in other states. 
The top 10 postal codes were also identified, providing further insight for marketing and upselling opportunities.

The analysis revealed some interesting trends about the market share of #TESLA, how #Jaguar is beating all other brands when it comes to distance covered in a single charge, market gap and opportunity for #BMW & #AUDI and how #Bentley is losing the competition in the EV pie.
